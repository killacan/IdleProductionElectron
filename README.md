# Idle Production (Electron Version)

### Overview

Hello and welcome to my project! This is a re-creation of my other game Idle Production. Idle Production was a challenge because I was transfering my existing project from vanilla JavaScript to an Nextron (Electron - Next.js) app. This was a technical challenge but I have accomplished getting it transfered over. 

### Why?

you might be wondering why I would do this? The primary reason is Apps and pages should be responsive and interactive, and a fun challenge for accomplishing this would be making a game! I wanted to distribute my app/game on steam. I also wanted to use my already existing JavaScript code from my JS project, so an Electron app seemed to be the best way to accomplish this.

### How?

This app is built on Electron, which allows for it to be a cross platform app, written in JavaScript. One of the primary limitations of this app is that it can't directly access the DOM, so everything had to be re-written for react. 

All of the assets are created by me, and the music is copyright free from Harris Heller. 

### Open Source

By making this game open source, I hope that people will reccomend changes, offer improvements, ect. This game is free, and will always be free. At no point am I going to add advertising, micro-transactions, cost, ect to this game.
